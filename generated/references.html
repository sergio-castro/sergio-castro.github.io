	Abstract = {Logic languages are well suited for declaratively solving computational problems that require knowledge representation and reasoning. Object-oriented programming languages benefit from mature software ecosystems featuring rich libraries and developer tools.
	Several integration solutions exist that allow a software system to be decomposed into a combination of modules implemented in both a logic and an object-oriented language. 
	Unfortunately, significative amounts of boilerplate code must still be written to accomplish the required interoperability. 
	In addition, such approaches often are not amenable to custom context-dependent reification of objects in the logic world and custom mappings of arbitrary logic terms to objects in the object-oriented world.
	Furthermore, in the specific case of Prolog-Java integration, existing solutions are often compatible with only a single or a restricted set of Prolog engines and thus suffer from portability issues.
	To address these problems, we introduce a portable framework, relying on linguistic integration, for transparently and (semi-)automatically enabling communication between routines in these two worlds, as well as a simple mechanism for customising how native artefacts in one language should be reified in the other language. 
	We validate our approach with case studies requiring a seamless integration of declarative programs in Prolog with libraries belonging to the Java ecosystem.},

	Abstract = {While object-oriented programming languages are good at
modelling real-world concepts and benefit from rich libraries and developer
tools, logic programming languages are well suited for declaratively
solving computational problems that require knowledge reasoning. Non-trivial
declarative applications could take advantage of the modelling features
of object-oriented programming and of the rich software ecosystems
surrounding them. Linguistic symbiosis is a common approach to enable
complementary use of languages of different paradigms. However, the
problem of concepts leaking from one paradigm to another often hinders
the applicability of such approaches. This issue has mainly been reported
for object-oriented languages participating in a symbiotic relation with
a logic language. To address this issue, we present LogicObjects, a linguistic
symbiosis framework for transparently and (semi-) automatically
enabling logic programming in Java, that aims to solve most of the problems
of paradigm leaking reported in other works.},

	Abstract = {While context-oriented programming technology so far has focused mostly on behavioral adaptation, context-oriented data management has received much less attention. In this paper we make a case for the problem of context-oriented data management, using a concrete example of a mobile application. We illustrate some of the issues involved and propose a lightweight persistency framework, called DynamicSchema, that resolves some of these issues. The solution consists in a flexible reification of the database schema, as a convenient dynamic data structure that can be adapted at execution time, according to sensed context changes. Implementing our mobile application using this framework enabled us to reduce the complexity of the domain modeling
layer, to facilitate the production of code with low memory footprint, and to simplify the implementation of certain scenarios related to context-dependent security concerns.},

	Abstract = {Correcting design decay in source code is not a trivial task. Diagnosing and subsequently correcting inconsistencies
between a software systems's code and its design rules (e.g., database queries are only allowed in the persistence
layer) and coding conventions can be complex, time-consuming and error-prone. Providing support for this process
is therefore highly desirable, but of a far greater complexity than suggesting basic corrective actions for simplistic
implementation problems (like the ``declare a local variable for non-declared variable'' suggested by Eclipse).
We present an abductive reasoning approach to inconsistency correction that consists of (1) a means for developers
to document and verify a system's design and coding rules, (2) an abductive logic reasoner that hypothesizes possible
causes of inconsistencies between the system's code and the documented rules and (3) a library of corrective actions
for each hypothesized cause. This work builds on our previous work, where we expressed design rules as equality
relationships between sets of source code artifacts (e.g., the set of methods in the persistence layer is the same as
the set of methods that query the database). In this paper, we generalize our approach to design rules expressed as
user-defined binary relationships between two sets of source code artifacts (e.g., every state changing method should
invoke a persistence method).
We illustrate our approach on the design of IntensiVE, a tool suite that enables defining sets of source code artifacts
intensionally (by means of logic queries) and verifying relationships between such sets.},

	Abstract = {The design and implementation of a software system is often governed by a variety
of coding conventions, design patterns, architectural guidelines, design rules, and other
so-called structural regularities. To prevent a deterioration of the system's source code,
it is important that these regularities are verified and enforced upon evolution of the
system. The Intensional Views Environment (IntensiVE), presented in this article, is a
tool suite for specifying relevant structural regularities in an (object-oriented) software
system and verifying them against the current and later versions of the system. At the
heart of the IntensiVE tool suite are (logic) program queries and the model of intensional
views and relations, through which regularities are expressed. Upon verification
of these regularities in the source code of the system, IntensiVE reports the code entities
(i.e. classes, methods, variables, statements, etc.) that violate these constraints.
We present IntensiVE and illustrate its application to the verification of an Abstract
Factory design pattern in the implementation of a software system.},

	Abstract = {Maintaining consistency between design and implementation is a fundamental issue in software evolution. Although a
certain number of existing tools and techniques provide support for correcting inconsistencies when found, they target
generally-applicable design rules. Unfortunately, in addition to these common design rules, any software system has
an abundance of custom design rules that are very specific to the system at hand. For such custom design rules,
verification and correction are often left to the developer or require a considerable investment in the implementation
of specific verification and correction metaprograms.
HEAL is a framework that alleviates the problem of diagnosing and correcting violations of custom design rules in
code. It supports the implementation and automatic inference of corrective actions (i.e. a program transformation) that
may solve a detected design inconsistency. Using an abductive logic reasoner, HEAL infers these corrective actions
from the design rules themselves and the code over which these rules are verified.
In a previous work we show how simple solutions are generated from a repository of corrective actions to low
level structural problems. In this work, we give one additional step showing that multiple solutions affecting the same
source code element can be composed, presenting to the programmer the complete vision of how the source code
would look like after executing a set of corrective actions.},

	Abstract = {In order to alleviate design decay, different program design
documentation techniques are used for the specification and
detection of design inconsistencies in code. However, these
design documentation techniques do not always provide support
for the diagnosis and (semi-) automatic correction of
such inconsistencies. In case they do, corrective solutions
are typically targeted to a reduced set of pre-defined inconsistency
problems, and they are not easily customizable to
new kinds of consistency checks defined by a user. In particular,
they cannot infer possible corrective actions to solve
new user-defined inconsistency problems. In this paper, we
present a technique for the diagnosis and (semi-) automatic
correction of inconsistencies in the context of an existing
tool for inconsistency management: IntensiVE. Our technique
uses logic abductive reasoning to infer solutions to detected
user-defined inconsistencies, starting from basic composable
corrective actions. A first prototype implementing
our technique on top of IntensiVE is shown.},

	Abstract = {The problem of managing inconsistencies in and between models is omnipresent in software engineering. Over the years many different inconsistency management approaches have been proposed by the research community. Because of the large diversity of backgrounds from which these approaches originate, it is difficult to pinpoint what they have in common and what not. As a result, researchers encounter difficulties when they want to position and compare their work with existing state-of-the-art, or when they collaborate on or combine different approaches. Also, end-users have a hard time to make an informed decision when selecting the most appropriate approaches. To address these problems, we propose a unifying conceptual framework of definitions and terminology, independent of any concrete inconsistency management approach or (modelling) language. This reference framework allows to gain a common understanding of what inconsistency management involves, what an inconsistency really means, and what the possible causes of an inconsistency can be. We demonstrate the genericity and usefulness of the framework by providing concrete instantiations of it to four different inconsistency management approaches. },

of these proposes different techniques and attempts to deal 
with different aspects regarding code design documenta- 
tion. Though this abundance of tools and techniques is a 
clear sign of the importance of such kind of tools in real 
life software implementation, it also creates confusion when 
trying to decide which one best suites the specific needs of 
a project. Adding to this confusion is the fact that different 
tools often use a different terminology for similar problems. 
Furthermore, the support offered by most of these tools is 
limited, since it is often based either on verifiable documen- 
tation that is not highly customizable, or customizable doc- 
umentation that cannot easily be verified. This paper takes 
initial steps in the direction of establishing a common vo- 
cabulary for describing code design documentation tools, 
and highlights the features that a verifiable and highly cus- 
tomizable tool should provide in order to satisfy most of the 
code design documentation requirements present in the im- 
plementation of complex software systems. },

	Abstract = {Current web-service composition languages, such as 
BPEL, provide inferior support for transaction management. 
Consequently, specifications written in these languages are need- 
lessly complex and hard to reuse. Furthermore, the languages 
themselves are not extensible, making them hard to adapt to 
support new forms of web service composition. Using a unified 
mechanism for dealing with transaction management we are able 
to simplify BPEL specifications, making them more reusable, 
and also allowing easy evolution of the language, addressing 
new forms of composition. In this paper we present DBCF, a 
framework that implements this unified mechanism. Moreover, 
we show how DBCF can be used as a basis for defining a BPEL 
extension that successfully addresses the above problems.},

	Abstract = {Advanced transaction management in loosely coupled environments is not a trivial task. 
Web Services are the current state of the art for interoperability for such kind of systems, 
and the BPEL4WS language is nowadays the de facto standard for web services composi- 
tion in industry. However, the BPEL4WS strategy for expressing transactional properties 
is limited, non extensible, and relies on different unrelated constructs for managing the 
concerns of activity synchronization, functional replication and activity compensation. We 
believe that these concerns should be managed using a more simpler, extensible and unified 
set of constructs, relying on well proved existing formal models for advanced transaction 
management. In this work we introduce such a composition framework called DBCF (De- 
pendency Based Composition Framework). DBCF demonstrates the viability of our con- 
ceptual model in service composition languages. In addition, we present an extension for 
BPEL4WS that adds these features, and suggest ways of describing declaratively transac- 
tional properties expressed with our proposed extension using aspect oriented technologies.
